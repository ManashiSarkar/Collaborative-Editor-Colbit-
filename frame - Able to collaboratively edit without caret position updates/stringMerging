1.old is sent to server
2.
	1.datafromserver will be compared to old, as datafromserver is the latest version
	2.new=getText() will be compared to old, as getText() will be the latest. 
	  if new == old, simply replace text with datafromserver
3.after marking what's new, what's deleted, all will be merged to old and setText()
4.highlight text that conflicts over changes in index, eg:inserted at same index, remove highlight on hover
